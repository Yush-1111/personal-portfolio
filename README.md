# Stellar Portfolio PRO â€” Admin Edition

This enhanced starter includes an admin dashboard to add/edit projects, UI polish, accessibility improvements, and performance-focused code splitting.

Run server and client as in previous README files.


Admin auth: register a user via POST /api/auth/register (you can run once), then login via /api/auth/login to get a token for admin actions. Uploads are stored in server/uploads and served at /uploads/<filename>.
